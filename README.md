# lser
![logo](./logo/lser_logo.png)

Your local server for development.

When you run `lser`, your IP address (IPv4) in your network will be displayed at the same time.  
This saves you the search of looking up the IP if you want to connect from another machine in the same network.

## Install

```
go install github.com/shinshin86/lser@latest
```

## Usage

```sh
lser

# When specifying a port number
lser -p 3001
```
